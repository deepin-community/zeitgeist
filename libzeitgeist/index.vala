     * The default boolean operator is %AND. Thus the query
     * //foo bar// will be interpreted as //foo AND bar//. To exclude a term
     * from the result set prepend it with a minus sign - eg. //foo -bar//.
     * Phrase queries can be done by double quoting the string
     * //"foo is a bar"//. You can truncate terms by appending a *.
     *
     * There are a few keys you can prefix to a term or phrase to search within
     * a specific set of metadata. They are used like //key:value//. The keys
     * //name// and //title// search strictly within the text field of the
     * event subjects. The key //app// searches within the application name or
     * description that is found in the actor attribute of the events. Lastly,
     * you can use the //site// key to search within the domain name of subject
     * URIs.
     *
     * You can also control the results with the boolean operators //AND// and
     * //OR// and you may use brackets, ( and ), to control the operator
     * precedence.
     *
     * FIXME: how do we put documentation into _finish?

     * result set by calling zeitgeist_result_set_estimated_matches(). This will
     * often be bigger than the actual number of events held in the result set,

     * zeitgeist_index_search().
