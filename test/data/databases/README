These SQL files can be used to reconstruct databases corresponding to
old Zeitgeist databases, containing the events from upgrade_test.js.

The procedure for creating or updating a SQL file is:
 - Download the old Zeitgeist version from Launchpad
 - Run ./configure and make
 - Copy run_fake_zeitgeist.sh into the directory and adapt it to
   work with that Zeitgeist version (eg., for Python versions,
   change "./src/zeitgeist-daemon" to "./zeitgeist-daemon").
 - Run the modified copy of run_fake_zeitgeist.sh
 - In the subshell, move into an up-to-date Zeitgeist checkout and run:
    $ ./tools/development/insert_events_from_json.py test/data/upgrade_test.js
 - Now move back into the temporary directory, and run:
    $ sqlite3 activity.sqlite .dump
